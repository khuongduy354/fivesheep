# Technical notes 

Since this is a demo app, some features aren't implemented correctly: 
- credentials should be put in .env files, some credentials in this source code is embedded directly, for purpose of testing
- question-dataset.js should be stored in MongoDB database, but it is placed in this repo as a mock database, for better visualization.
